      title: "GPPO Troop Deployment Tracker",
      description: "During my internship at the Guimaras Provincial Police Office, I observed officers struggling with Google Maps for troop deploymentâ€”it lacked customization and critical operational features. Recognizing this gap, I proposed and developed a comprehensive tracking solution.",
      challenges: "The biggest challenge was overcoming Android's aggressive background process management, especially during battery saver mode, which would kill the APK and break real-time tracking. I solved this through strategic use of Capacitor's background geolocation plugins, Firebase's persistent connections, and intelligent app lifecycle management.",
      result: "The result is a robust system that maintains continuous tracking even under the most restrictive OS conditions, providing officers with reliable real-time troop positioning and deployment coordination.",

      description: "I built this because I noticed that information was scattered across different school portals, making it difficult for students to stay updated. So I came up with an idea to create a centralized web app for all school news.",
      challenges: "The main challenge was ensuring data consistency and avoiding duplicate entries while scraping from multiple sources. I also needed to handle different portal structures and maintain the system's reliability. I solved this by implementing intelligent deduplication logic, error handling for various portal formats, and robust GitHub Actions workflows with proper error recovery.",
      result: "The clever part? I implemented automated data scraping using GitHub Actions that runs every 2 hours, automatically fetching only new data and saving it to my database. This way, I can just sit back and watch the system maintain itselfâ€”no manual updates needed. The result is a seamless, always-updated platform that consolidates all university communications in one place.",

She needed a simple e-commerce app with GCash payment integration, so I created a full-featured platform with a complete admin panel for product management.",
      challenges: "The challenge was making it simple enough for a teenager to use while including all the essential e-commerce features. I had to design an intuitive admin interface, implement secure payment processing with GCash, and ensure the database structure was both scalable and user-friendly. I also needed to handle inventory management and order processing in a way that a 13-year-old could understand and manage effectively.",
      result: "The result is a modern, user-friendly store that empowers young entrepreneurs to start their business journey. The admin panel provides complete CRUD operations, real-time inventory tracking, and secure payment processing, all wrapped in an interface that's accessible to young users.",
